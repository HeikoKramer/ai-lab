# AI Lab

## Overview
This repository captures experiments, documentation, and planning artifacts for building and maintaining an AI development lab focused on GPU-accelerated workflows.

## Repository Contents
- [ai-notes.md](./ai-notes.md) – Living documentation of lessons learned, command references, and verification scripts from the AI development journey.
- [next-steps.md](./next-steps.md) – Current list of actionable follow-up tasks for the lab.

## Future Structure
New projects, prototypes, or datasets should be organized in dedicated directories at the repository root. Each addition should be linked from this README with a short description once it is available.
