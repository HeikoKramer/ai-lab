## AI Environment Setup for PyTorch + CUDA 12.8 (RTX 5080)

This chapter consolidates the foundational concepts required to build a GPU-enabled PyTorch environment on an RTX 5080 with CUDA 12.8 support.

### 1. Virtual Environments (`venv`)

**Purpose:**
A *virtual environment* is an isolated Python workspace that keeps your project dependencies separate from the system-wide Python installation.

**Why it matters:**
- Prevents version conflicts between projects.
- Keeps your global Python installation clean.
- Makes project sharing and reproducibility easier.

**Commands:**
```bash
# Create a new directory for your AI work
mkdir -p ~/projects/ai-lab
cd ~/projects/ai-lab

# Create a new virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv

# Activate the environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Check which Python interpreter is used
which python
```
Expected output:
```
/home/<user>/projects/ai-lab/.venv/bin/python
```
This confirms you are inside the virtual environment (notice the `.venv` prefix in your shell prompt).

---

### 2. Package Management: `pip`, `setuptools`, `wheel`

**Purpose:**
These are the essential tools for Python package installation.
- **pip**: Installs Python packages from PyPI or custom repositories.
- **setuptools**: Handles building and installing Python projects.
- **wheel**: Supports the binary package format `.whl`, which installs faster than source builds.

**Command to upgrade them:**
```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
```
Expected output:
```
Successfully installed pip-25.x setuptools-80.x wheel-0.45.x
```
This ensures compatibility with the latest library versions.

---

### 3. PyTorch

**Purpose:**
[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) is a machine learning framework widely used for deep learning and AI model development. It supports both CPU and GPU computations.

**Installation (with CUDA support):**
To install PyTorch with GPU acceleration, use the following command:
```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128
```
- `torch`: Core deep learning library.
- `torchvision`: Image-related utilities (datasets, transformations, pretrained models).
- `torchaudio`: Audio-related utilities and datasets.
- `cu128`: Specifies CUDA 12.8, matching your NVIDIA driver and GPU architecture.

**Nightly Builds:**
If your GPU or CUDA version is newer than the stable PyTorch release, you can install a *nightly build* (development version):
```bash
pip install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu128
```
Nightly builds are often necessary to support new GPUs (like the RTX 5080).

---

### 4. CUDA and GPU Compatibility

**CUDA** (Compute Unified Device Architecture) is NVIDIA’s framework that allows software (like PyTorch) to use GPUs for computation.

- Each GPU architecture has a unique **SM (Streaming Multiprocessor)** version (e.g., `sm_90`, `sm_120`).
- CUDA and PyTorch must support your GPU’s SM version.

**SM Compatibility Table (simplified):**
| Architecture | GPU Series         | SM Version |
|---------------|--------------------|-------------|
| Volta         | Tesla V100         | sm_70       |
| Turing        | RTX 20xx           | sm_75       |
| Ampere        | RTX 30xx           | sm_80       |
| Ada Lovelace  | RTX 40xx           | sm_89/90    |
| Blackwell     | RTX 50xx           | sm_120      |

If your GPU shows as *unsupported*, upgrade to a newer CUDA toolkit or a nightly PyTorch build.

---

### 5. Testing PyTorch GPU Support

You can verify GPU detection and CUDA functionality with this script:

```bash
python - <<'PY'
import torch
print("torch:", torch.__version__)
print("cuda available:", torch.cuda.is_available())
if torch.cuda.is_available():
    print("arch list:", torch.cuda.get_arch_list())
    print("device name:", torch.cuda.get_device_name(0))
    x = torch.randn(256, 256, device="cuda")
    y = torch.matmul(x, x)
    print("successful multiply", y.shape)
PY
```

**Expected Output:**
```
torch: 2.1.0.dev20251002+cu128
cuda available: True
arch list: ['sm_70', 'sm_75', 'sm_80', 'sm_86', 'sm_90', 'sm_100', 'sm_120']
device name: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080
successful multiply torch.Size([256, 256])
```
This confirms:
- PyTorch is running with CUDA 12.8.
- GPU recognized as RTX 5080.
- The test computation successfully ran on the GPU.

---

### 6. Version Checks and Utilities

**Check CUDA Toolkit Version:**
```bash
nvcc --version
```

**Check NVIDIA Driver & GPU Info:**
```bash
nvidia-smi
```

**Check PyTorch CUDA Version:**
```bash
python -c "import torch; print(torch.version.cuda)"
```

**Check PyTorch GPU Detection:**
```bash
python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.get_device_name(0))"
```

**Force reinstall latest nightly build:**
```bash
pip install --upgrade --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu128
```

---

### 7. TorchVision and TorchAudio

- **torchvision** adds prebuilt datasets (e.g., CIFAR, ImageNet), image transformations, and pretrained CNN models.
- **torchaudio** provides similar functionality for audio datasets and signal processing.

Example test:
```bash
python - <<'PY'
import torchvision, torchaudio
print("torchvision:", torchvision.__version__)
print("torchaudio:", torchaudio.__version__)
PY
```
Expected output:
```
torchvision: 0.20.x
torchaudio: 2.2.x
```

---

### 8. Notes on Nightly Builds

- Nightly versions (`--pre`) are built automatically from the latest commits.
- They may include early support for new GPUs or CUDA toolkits.
- Slight instability is possible, but they’re ideal for testing and cutting-edge hardware.

To downgrade to a stable version later:
```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128 --force-reinstall
```

---

### 9. Summary of Key Learnings

| Concept | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **venv** | Isolated Python environment for dependencies |
| **pip / setuptools / wheel** | Core Python packaging tools |
| **PyTorch** | Machine learning framework supporting GPU acceleration |
| **CUDA** | NVIDIA's framework to run GPU computations |

---

### 10. End-to-End Setup Blueprint

This subsection condenses the essential actions from Sections 1–9 into a practical workflow that can be followed from a clean system to a validated GPU-enabled PyTorch environment.

1. **Prepare the workspace** by creating a project directory and activating a Python virtual environment to isolate dependencies and guarantee reproducibility.
2. **Upgrade foundational packaging tools** (`pip`, `setuptools`, and `wheel`) to ensure compatibility with the latest binary distributions and to speed up installations.
3. **Install PyTorch with matching CUDA support**, optionally selecting the nightly channel when targeting cutting-edge GPUs or driver/toolkit combinations.
4. **Verify CUDA and driver alignment** by checking GPU architecture support tables, confirming the installed CUDA toolkit, and reviewing driver status with `nvidia-smi`.
5. **Run GPU functionality tests** in PyTorch to confirm device discovery, architecture availability, and successful execution of tensor operations on the GPU.
6. **Validate auxiliary libraries** such as TorchVision and TorchAudio to ensure that vision and audio tooling versions align with the installed PyTorch build.
7. **Document key learnings**—including SM mappings, packaging utilities, and nightly build considerations—to retain institutional knowledge for future setup iterations.

Use this blueprint whenever you need a succinct, end-to-end reminder of the environment setup process; each bullet links conceptually back to the detailed chapters above.

## Working with Hugging Face

This chapter summarizes the key workflows for exploring models on Hugging Face and running inference with the `transformers` library.

### Models

#### 1. Transformers Overview

**Purpose:**
The `transformers` library centralizes state-of-the-art Transformer architectures (e.g., GPT, BERT, T5, Whisper, Stable Diffusion) with ready-to-use APIs.

**What it handles for you:**
- Downloading and loading pretrained models and tokenizers.
- Converting raw text, audio, or images into tensors the models can process.
- Running inference across CPUs and GPUs with device-aware optimizations.
- Formatting and post-processing model outputs into human-readable results.

#### 2. Install the Library

Install or upgrade to the latest release of `transformers`:

```bash
pip install --upgrade transformers
```

This ensures you receive current model definitions, tokenizer updates, and pipeline improvements.

#### 3. Navigating the Model Hub

The **Models** tab on [huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co/models) is the central directory for community and official checkpoints.

- Use filters for task, dataset, library, language, license, and hardware requirements.
- Sort models by Most Downloads, Trending, or Most Liked to surface popular checkpoints.
- Each **Model Card** provides: overview and intended use, example code snippets, evaluation metrics (per dataset or benchmark), training data references, licensing terms, and known limitations or ethical considerations.
- KPIs to watch include download counts, likes, last modified date, supported tasks, and compatible libraries.

#### 4. Pipelines Quickstart

`pipeline` offers a high-level interface for rapid experimentation:

```python
from transformers import pipeline

generator = pipeline("text-generation", model="gpt2")
result = generator("The future of open science", max_new_tokens=20)
print(result[0]["generated_text"])
```

- Automatically selects the appropriate tokenizer and model classes for the task.
- Accepts text, audio, or vision inputs depending on the pipeline type.
- Returns structured outputs such as generated text, classification labels, or transcription segments.

#### 5. Pipeline Execution Internals

When a pipeline runs, it orchestrates several steps:

1. Loads the matching `AutoTokenizer` and `AutoModel` (or task-specific subclasses).
2. Downloads the latest weights from the Hugging Face Hub if they are not already cached locally.
3. Tokenizes the input prompt and maps it to tensors for the target device (CPU or GPU).
4. Streams the tensors through the model to produce logits and decoded outputs.
5. Applies task-specific post-processing (e.g., text decoding, probability sorting, or audio chunk stitching).

#### 6. Model Management and Caching

- Authenticate once with `huggingface-cli login` to access private models or higher rate limits.
- By default, models and tokenizers are cached under `~/.cache/huggingface`; reuse of the same model avoids repeated downloads.
- Remove a directory within the cache to force a fresh download when updated weights are released.
- Set the `HF_HOME` environment variable if you prefer a custom cache location.

#### 7. Version Checks and Quick Tests

Keep tooling aligned and validate that everything runs on the intended hardware:

```bash
pip install --upgrade "transformers[torch]" huggingface-hub
```

```bash
python - <<'PY'
import torch

print("torch:", torch.__version__)
print("cuda available:", torch.cuda.is_available())
if torch.cuda.is_available():
    print("device:", torch.cuda.get_device_name(0))
    print("cuda toolkit:", torch.version.cuda)
PY
```

```python
from transformers import pipeline

generator = pipeline("text-generation", model="gpt2", device_map="auto")
output = generator("This AI assistant always", max_new_tokens=20)
print(output[0]["generated_text"])
```

The first command synchronizes core dependencies, the second verifies PyTorch GPU support, and the final snippet confirms that a Hugging Face model can be loaded and executed locally.

#### 8. Task Selection and Model Matching

**Purpose:**
Reduce guesswork when choosing a checkpoint by mapping your use case to the right task, filtering the Hub effectively, and validating that the model meets latency and accuracy expectations.

**Common tasks and starter checkpoints:**

| Task | Typical Input/Output | Lightweight baseline | High-capacity option |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `text-generation` | Prompt → extended narrative | `distilgpt2` (fast CPU inference) | `meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct` (better reasoning) |
| `question-answering` | Context passage + question → answer span | `distilbert-base-cased-distilled-squad` | `deepset/roberta-base-squad2` |
| `summarization` | Long article → concise abstract | `sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6` | `facebook/bart-large-cnn` |
| `translation` | Source language text → target language text | `Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-de-en` | `facebook/nllb-200-distilled-600M` |
| `sentence-similarity` | Pair of texts → similarity score | `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` | `sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2` |

**Selection checklist:**

1. **Define the task category** before browsing. The Hub’s task filter mirrors the `pipeline` task argument, so locking this down narrows results instantly.
2. **Set constraints** on model size, quantization format, and hardware (CPU vs. GPU vs. MPS). Smaller distilled models keep latency low; larger instruction-tuned checkpoints improve accuracy at the cost of memory.
3. **Compare evaluation metrics** in the model card (e.g., F1 for QA, ROUGE for summarization). Favor models evaluated on datasets that resemble your target domain.
4. **Review training data and licenses** to ensure compliance with your deployment scenario, especially for commercial or proprietary contexts.
5. **Prototype with a pipeline** using the short-listed model to validate answers on your own samples. Measure runtime and output quality before promoting it to production.

**Tip:** Save curated model shortlists in a shared note or spreadsheet with columns for task, model ID, parameters, eval metrics, and qualitative observations. This institutional memory speeds up future evaluations.

### Datasets

#### 1. Load a Dataset

**Purpose:**
`datasets` lets you pull curated datasets from the Hugging Face Hub with a single call.

**Command:**
```python
from datasets import load_dataset

dataset = load_dataset("TWI-RM/BIOMERT_Italian")
print(type(dataset))
```

**Expected output:**
```
DatasetDict
```

The loader returns an Arrow-backed `DatasetDict` (splits as keys, `Dataset` objects as values) ready for inspection or iteration.

#### 2. Standard Splits

Most Hub datasets ship with named splits so you can immediately separate training and evaluation data.

| Split | Primary use | Typical share |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| `train` | Model fitting | 70–80% |
| `validation` | Hyperparameter tuning and early stopping | 10–15% |
| `test` | Final unbiased evaluation | 10–15% |

You can load an individual split on demand:

```python
train = load_dataset("TWI-RM/BIOMERT_Italian", split="train")
print(len(train))
```

#### 3. Dataset Cards

Each dataset has a Dataset Card that documents the source, schema, licensing, and recommended uses. Read it before integrating a dataset to confirm label definitions, preprocessing steps, and ethical considerations. The card also links to benchmarks and related work that inform how to evaluate your model.

#### 4. Apache Arrow Storage

Hugging Face stores tables in Apache Arrow for fast columnar access:

- Arrow is a binary column store that reads efficiently on CPU and GPU.
- It is interoperable with frameworks like Pandas, PyTorch, and TensorFlow.
- Datasets stream from disk via memory mapping, keeping the memory footprint low.
- Reusing the same dataset does not require a reload because Arrow caching persists between sessions.

Loaders return Arrow-native blocks automatically, so you can treat each split like an in-memory dataset while benefiting from lazy loading.

#### 5. Working with Partitions

**What is a partition?**
A *partition* is any subset of records that together form a complete, non-overlapping division of a dataset. The Hugging Face `DatasetDict` treats the familiar `train`, `validation`, and `test` splits as first-class partitions, but you can create as many additional groups as you need (for example, a `holdout` set for long-term regression testing or an `inference` slice for demo traffic).

**Why partitions matter:**
- They keep evaluation honest by ensuring models never see the held-out examples during training.
- They let you tailor preprocessing: heavy augmentations might apply only to the training partition, while deterministic tokenization is shared across all partitions.
- They support reproducibility; storing the slicing logic in code guarantees that teammates regenerate identical partitions.

**Standard partitioning workflows:**
1. **Named split selection** – Load the predefined partitions the dataset author published. This is the default when you call `load_dataset("<name>")`.
2. **Percentage-based slicing** – Request custom ratios (e.g., 80/10/10) when the dataset ships as a single table. This is the most common option for personal or internal corpora.
3. **Stratified sampling** – Balance the class distribution across partitions by filtering before you slice or by using `train_test_split` with the `stratify_by_column` argument.
4. **Deterministic shards** – Fix a random seed so that partitions stay stable across runs, which is essential for comparing experiments over time.

**Example: create percentage-based partitions**

```python
custom = load_dataset(
    "mc4",
    split={
        "train": "train[:90%]",
        "validation": "train[90%:95%]",
        "test": "train[95%:]",
    },
)
print({name: len(part) for name, part in custom.items()})
```

Each partition behaves like a regular `Dataset`, so you can inspect schema metadata, iterate through examples, or combine subsets. For example, you can temporarily merge the training and validation partitions for a larger fine-tuning run, then re-separate them as needed:

```python
from datasets import concatenate_datasets

train = custom["train"]
validation = custom["validation"]
merged = concatenate_datasets([train, validation])
print(train.column_names)
print(merged.num_rows)
```

When you need stratified or random splits, reach for the built-in helper:

```python
balanced = train.train_test_split(
    test_size=0.2,
    seed=42,
    stratify_by_column="label",
)
print({name: len(part) for name, part in balanced.items()})
```

This workflow keeps preprocessing centralized while letting you express advanced partitioning strategies—random shuffles, class-balanced samples, or experiment-specific holdouts—directly in code.


### Text Classification

This chapter outlines common text-classification tasks available through Hugging Face pipelines, emphasizing how to interpret predictions across customer feedback, education, and question-answering scenarios.

#### 1. Sentiment Analysis

**Purpose:** Assigns a sentiment label (positive, negative, neutral) to subjective text so teams can monitor customer or user reactions at scale.

**Applications:** Review moderation, social listening dashboards, support-ticket triage.

**Example: DistilBERT sentiment pipeline**

```python
from transformers import pipeline

my_pipeline = pipeline(
    "text-classification",
    model="distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english",
)
print(my_pipeline("Wi-Fi is slower than a snail today!"))
```

**Expected output:**

```
[{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.99}]
```

**Interpretation:** The model is highly confident the sentence expresses a negative sentiment about the Wi-Fi experience.

#### 2. Grammatical Correctness

**Purpose:** Evaluates whether text follows grammatical rules, helping educators and content reviewers surface errors quickly.

**Applications:** Language-learning tools, editorial review, quality assurance for autogenerated content.

**Example: English grammar checker**

```python
from transformers import pipeline

grammar_checker = pipeline(
    task="text-classification",
    model="abdulmattinomtoso/English_Grammar_Checker",
)

print(grammar_checker("He eat pizza every day."))
```

**Expected output:**

```
[{'label': 'LABEL_0', 'score': 0.99}]
```

**Interpretation:** The pipeline flags the sentence as unacceptable (LABEL_0) with strong confidence because the verb tense is incorrect.

#### 3. Question-Answering Natural Language Inference (QNLI)

**Purpose:** Determines whether a statement (premise) supports the answer to a question, which is essential for fact-checking and knowledge retrieval systems.

**Applications:** Q&A assistants, automated support bots, content validation pipelines.

**Example: Cross-encoder QNLI classifier**

```python
from transformers import pipeline

classifier = pipeline(
    task="text-classification",
    model="cross-encoder/qnli-electra-base",
)

text = "Where is Seattle located? Seattle is located in Washington state."
print(classifier(text))
```

**Expected output:**

```
[{'label': 'LABEL_0', 'score': 0.997}]
```

**Interpretation:** LABEL_0 denotes entailment, so the model confirms the premise supports the answer to the question.

#### 4. Dynamic Category Assignment

**Purpose:** Performs zero-shot classification by mapping free-form text to whichever labels you provide at runtime, enabling flexible routing without task-specific fine-tuning.

**Applications:** Content moderation, intelligent routing for support queues, personalized recommendation flows.

**Example: Routing user request categories**

```python
from transformers import pipeline

classifier = pipeline(
    task="zero-shot-classification",
    model="facebook/bart-large-mnli",
)

text = "Hi team, the analytics dashboard shows an error every time I log in."
categories = ["Billing Question", "Product Feedback", "Technical Support"]

output = classifier(text, candidate_labels=categories)
print({"labels": output["labels"], "scores": [round(score, 3) for score in output["scores"]]})
```

**Expected output:**

```
{'labels': ['Technical Support', 'Product Feedback', 'Billing Question'], 'scores': [0.934, 0.045, 0.021]}
```

**Interpretation:** The request is confidently routed to the Technical Support queue, while other categories receive negligible probability.

#### 5. Challenges of Text Classification

Text classifiers must contend with several linguistic hurdles:

- **Ambiguity:** The same phrase can carry different meanings depending on context or domain jargon.
- **Sarcasm and irony:** Surface-level wording may oppose the intended sentiment, confusing literal models.
- **Multilingual input:** Classifiers trained on one language can misinterpret code-switching or regional expressions.

### Text Summarization

This chapter demonstrates how Hugging Face pipelines condense source text into shorter narratives, contrasting extractive and abstractive workflows and highlighting how token parameters influence output length.

#### 1. Summarization Overview

**Purpose:** Reduce lengthy passages to focused summaries that preserve the key message while omitting redundant or tangential details.

**Process:**
- Accept full sentences or short paragraphs as input.
- Compress them into concise statements or bullet-style highlights.
- Maintain factual accuracy so downstream teams can make decisions quickly.

#### 2. Extractive vs. Abstractive Approaches

| Approach     | How it works                                                      | Strengths     | Considerations                                |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Extractive   | Selects the most informative sentences directly from the source.  | Fast, factual, minimal hallucination risk. | May keep awkward phrasing or irrelevant detail |
| Abstractive  | Generates new text that paraphrases the source content.           | Fluent, coherent, adapts to narrative tone. | Requires guardrails to avoid fabrication       |

#### 3. Use Cases for Extractive Summarization

- **Legal brief triage:** Surface pivotal clauses so attorneys can skim precedence quickly.
- **Financial alerts:** Lift sentences describing revenue swings or guidance updates for analysts.

#### 4. Extractive Summarization in Action

```python
from transformers import pipeline

summarizer = pipeline("summarization", model="myamuda/extractive-summarization")

text = (
    "City council members met for a short session to approve the river cleanup budget. "
    "They highlighted that volunteer turnout doubled compared to last year, "
    "and the plan prioritizes removing plastic debris along the south bank."
)

summary = summarizer(text)
print(summary[0]["summary_text"])
```

**Expected output:**

```
City council members met for a short session to approve the river cleanup budget.
```

**Interpretation:** The extractive pipeline selects the most informative sentence verbatim, preserving factual wording from the source paragraph.

#### 5. Use Cases for Abstractive Summarization

- **News digests:** Provide concise recaps of local events without repeating the entire article.
- **Content recommendations:** Rephrase long-form reviews into short hooks for readers.

#### 6. Abstractive Summarization in Action

```python
from transformers import pipeline

summarizer = pipeline("summarization", model="sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6")

text = (
    "The neighborhood gardening club planted a pollinator garden beside the library. "
    "Volunteers logged the soil quality, chose low-maintenance flowers, and scheduled "
    "weekly watering shifts so families can learn about native plants."
)

summary = summarizer(text)
print(summary[0]["summary_text"])
```

**Expected output:**

```
The club organized a pollinator garden project near the library and set up a family-friendly maintenance plan.
```

**Interpretation:** The abstractive pipeline rewrites the source into a fluent sentence that blends the key actions into a single narrative.

#### 7. Controlling Summary Length with Token Parameters

```python
from transformers import pipeline

summarizer = pipeline(
    task="summarization",
    model="sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6",
    min_new_tokens=15,
    max_new_tokens=40,
)

text = (
    "A high school robotics club built a solar-powered rover for the science expo. "
    "Students documented the build process, trained volunteers to operate the rover, "
    "and presented test results that showed longer battery life than last year's design."
)

shorter_summary = pipeline(
    task="summarization",
    model="sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6",
    min_new_tokens=5,
    max_new_tokens=15,
)(text)[0]["summary_text"]

medium_summary = summarizer(text)[0]["summary_text"]

longer_summary = pipeline(
    task="summarization",
    model="sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6",
    min_new_tokens=30,
    max_new_tokens=60,
)(text)[0]["summary_text"]

print("Short:", shorter_summary)
print("Medium:", medium_summary)
print("Long:", longer_summary)
```

**Expected output:**

```
Short: Students built a solar rover and proved it lasts longer.
Medium: The robotics club built a solar-powered rover, trained volunteers, and reported longer battery life than last year.
Long: Students in the robotics club built a solar-powered rover, documented each step, trained volunteers to drive it, and shared test data showing the new model outperforms last year's design.
```

#### 8. Interpreting Token Length Effects

- **Shorter setting:** Lower `min_new_tokens` and `max_new_tokens` force a brief highlight at the expense of nuance.
- **Medium setting:** Balanced token bounds retain the main actions without unnecessary detail.
- **Longer setting:** Higher token limits allow the model to elaborate on supporting context while staying within the summarization scope.

### Document Q&A

#### 1. Concept Overview

- **Objective:** Answer natural-language questions by grounding responses in source documents such as PDFs, manuals, or policy guides.
- **Inputs:** A reference document (often chunked into passages) and a user question.
- **Output:** A concise answer plus optional metadata (confidence score, source span) that points back to the document.
- **Why it matters:** Document-grounded answers reduce hallucinations and keep HR, finance, or support teams aligned with approved content.

#### 2. Sample Scenario

Imagine an internal HR handbook stored as a PDF. We will work with a file named `US-Employee_Policy.pdf`, where page 7 contains the volunteer-time policy. Before we can pass the content to a QA model, we need to extract the text from the PDF and confirm exactly which page holds the relevant paragraph.

```python
from pypdf import PdfReader

reader = PdfReader("US-Employee_Policy.pdf")
page_number = 6  # zero-based index; page 7 in the printed handbook
document_text = reader.pages[page_number].extract_text()

print(f"US-Employee_Policy.pdf — Page {page_number + 1}\n" + "-" * 50)
print(document_text)
```

The output confirms that page 7 includes the passage we need:

```
US-Employee_Policy.pdf — Page 7
--------------------------------------------------
Annual volunteer day program
• Each full-time employee is eligible for 12 hours of volunteer time off per calendar year.
• Requests must be submitted two weeks in advance through the HR portal.
• Managers will confirm coverage needs before approvals are issued.
```

This extraction step matters for two reasons:

1. **Traceability:** When HR reviews the answer later, they can open the PDF to page 7 and verify the wording line by line.
2. **Reliable preprocessing:** QA pipelines depend on clean, machine-readable text. Automating the PDF-to-text step avoids manual copy/paste errors and keeps long documents searchable.

If an employee asks, "How many volunteer hours do we receive each year?", the answer should be verifiable against the highlighted bullet. With the `document_text` string captured above, we can now feed the exact PDF content into a QA pipeline.

#### 3. Build a Minimal Pipeline

```python
from transformers import pipeline

qa_pipeline = pipeline(
    task="question-answering",
    model="distilbert-base-cased-distilled-squad",
)

context = document_text

question = "How many volunteer hours do we receive each year?"

result = qa_pipeline(question=question, context=context)

print("Answer:", result["answer"])
print("Confidence:", round(result["score"], 3))
```

**What to expect:**

```
Answer: 12 hours
Confidence: 0.842
```

The model extracts the phrase "12 hours" because it matches the question’s semantics and appears in the provided context segment.

#### 4. Verification Checklist

1. **Traceability:** Confirm that the predicted answer text exactly matches a span in the extracted passage. Here, "12 hours" aligns with the second bullet in the PDF excerpt.
2. **Context coverage:** Ensure the context string contains all sentences needed to interpret the question. Add surrounding bullets or headings when meaning could be ambiguous.
3. **Chunking strategy:** For long PDFs, split pages or sections into overlapping chunks (~200–400 tokens) and feed each chunk to the pipeline before selecting the highest-scoring answer.
4. **Model suitability:** If answers sound uncertain or hallucinated, try a larger QA model (e.g., `deepset/roberta-base-squad2`) or fine-tune on domain-specific Q&A pairs.
5. **Human validation:** Keep a manual review step for high-impact answers so stakeholders can compare the model output with the authoritative source.

### Auto Models and Tokenizers

This chapter translates the automatic class machinery in `transformers` into actionable steps. Auto classes remove guesswork when pairing checkpoints with the exact Python implementations that know how to run them.

#### 1. AutoModel Essentials

- **Core idea:** Each AutoModel class inspects the model card metadata (`config.json`) and instantiates the concrete architecture (e.g., `BertForSequenceClassification`) without you hardcoding the class name.
- **Task-specific loaders:**

  | AutoModel class | Typical task | Notes |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `AutoModelForSequenceClassification` | Text classification, sentiment analysis, intent detection | Adds classification heads with logits over labels. |
  | `AutoModelForTokenClassification` | Named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging | Produces token-level logits. |
  | `AutoModelForCausalLM` | Text generation, chat models | Supports sampling/beam search over next-token probabilities. |
  | `AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM` | Translation, abstractive summarization | Handles encoder-decoder checkpoints. |
  | `AutoModel` | Backbone-only representation | Returns hidden states without task heads. |

- **Usage pattern:**

  ```python
  from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification

  model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(
      "distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english"
  )
  logits = model(**tokenized_batch).logits
  ```

- **Pipelines vs. auto classes:** Pipelines deliver a turnkey experience (single function call, implicit device handling), while auto classes expose every intermediate step—ideal for custom training loops, gradient inspection, and advanced batching.

#### 2. AutoTokenizer Workflow

AutoTokenizers are the text-processing counterparts to AutoModels. They clean input, break it into tokens, and convert those tokens into numerical IDs that the model understands.

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased")
tokens = tokenizer("AI helps humans", return_tensors="pt")
```

**Flow of text through an AutoTokenizer:**

```
Raw text
  ↓ normalize (lowercase, strip accents, apply rules)
Normalized text
  ↓ tokenize (WordPiece, BPE, SentencePiece)
Tokens ("ai", "helps", "humans")
  ↓ map to IDs via vocabulary
Token IDs ([993, 1256, 4820])
  ↓ package inputs (add CLS/SEP, pad, create attention masks)
Model-ready batch
```

- **Pairing matters:** Always load the tokenizer with the exact identifier you use for the model. Checkpoints can introduce new special tokens or change normalization rules; the paired tokenizer knows about those updates.
- **Cased vs. uncased checkpoints:**
  - *Uncased* models (e.g., `distilbert-base-uncased`) lowercase tokens, which boosts robustness on informal text and social media content.
  - *Cased* models (e.g., `bert-base-cased`) preserve capitalization for languages or domains where case carries meaning (named entities, German nouns).
- **Byte pair vs. WordPiece:** DistilBERT/ BERT rely on WordPiece (prefix `##` for subwords), while RoBERTa variants use BPE (`Ġ` to mark spaces). The AutoTokenizer selects the proper algorithm automatically.

#### 3. Matching Models and Tokenizers

- **One metadata source:** The tokenizer is resolved via the model's configuration; there is no separate "AutoTokenizer per model" registry you must maintain.
- **Consequences of mismatches:** Using `AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("roberta-base")` with a DistilBERT checkpoint yields incompatible token IDs, similar to sending Morse code to a Braille reader—decoding fails because token IDs map to different embeddings.
- **Quick compatibility check:** After loading, compare `tokenizer.vocab_size` with the model's `config.vocab_size`. A mismatch indicates the wrong tokenizer or an outdated cache.
- **Selecting the right Auto class:** `AutoTokenizer` dispatches to the correct concrete implementation (`BertTokenizer`, `RobertaTokenizerFast`, etc.) based on configuration flags. You rarely need to import these specialized classes manually.

#### 4. Uploading Artifacts to Hugging Face

When you train a model locally (as an individual, a company, or a research lab), pushing to the Hugging Face Hub collects all necessary artifacts:

1. Run `huggingface-cli repo create <namespace>/<model-name>` (or create via the web UI).
2. Place the following files in your local repository:
   - `config.json`: architecture hyperparameters.
   - `pytorch_model.bin` (or `safetensors`): trained weights.
   - `tokenizer.json`, `tokenizer_config.json`, `special_tokens_map.json`, merges/vocab files as required by the tokenizer.
3. Use `AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(<path>)` and `AutoModel.from_pretrained(<path>)` locally to validate loading before publishing.
4. Push with `huggingface-cli upload` or `git push` (after adding the Hub remote). The Hub auto-detects tokenizer assets and wires them to the model card so downstream users get the paired setup via a single identifier.

#### 5. Common Pitfalls Checklist

| Scenario | Symptom | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tokenizer not paired with model | `RuntimeError: The tokenizer class you are using is not the same as the one used during training.` | Re-download with the same repo ID and clear stale cache entries. |
| Using pipelines for complex training loops | Limited control over batching, gradients, and logging. | Switch to explicit `AutoModel` + `AutoTokenizer` usage to own the data flow. |
| Forgetting case handling | Lowercase text fed into a cased model performs poorly on names. | Match preprocessing to the checkpoint (keep case for cased models). |
| Missing files when pushing to Hub | Model card shows "Tokenizer missing" or "Config missing" warnings. | Include tokenizer configuration files and rerun `huggingface-cli upload`. |
| Custom special tokens ignored | Generation outputs skip task-specific markers. | Call `tokenizer.add_special_tokens(...)` **before** resizing the model embeddings and retraining/fine-tuning. |
