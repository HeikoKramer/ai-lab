# Repository Guidelines

- **Language:** All repository content, including documentation, code comments, commit messages, and configuration entries, must be written in English. Do not use emojis unless explicitly requested.
- **Scope:** These guidelines apply to the entire repository unless superseded by a more specific `AGENTS.md` in a subdirectory.

## File-Specific Expectations

### README.md
- Treat this file as the table of contents for the repository.
- Provide concise descriptions of important locations, projects, and documentation, each with links to the relevant files or folders.
- Keep the overview up to date when new major areas are added.

### ai-notes.md
- Document the current understanding and key explanations from the AI development journey.
- Focus on insights, commands, and verification steps rather than upcoming tasks.
- Maintain a table of contents that links to the major sections.
- Treat the "AI Environment Setup for PyTorch + CUDA 12.8 (RTX 5080)" chapter as the stylistic reference for future additions; new chapters should match its concise, action-oriented tone and structure.

### next-steps.md
- Record actionable next steps for the overall repository.
- Keep entries current and remove items once completed or no longer relevant.
- Mark completed items using Markdown strikethrough (e.g., `~~Task~~`). Items 1â€“3 are already completed and should remain crossed out.
